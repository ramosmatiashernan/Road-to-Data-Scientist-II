# Road to Data Scientist II (Binary Classification Problem)

In this project, a machine learning binary classification model has been developed for a scenario where a company wants to know which of the candidates are really wanting to work for the company after training or looking for a new employment. Predicting this behaviour helps to reduce the cost and time as well as the quality of training or planning for the courses and categorization of candidates decision.
